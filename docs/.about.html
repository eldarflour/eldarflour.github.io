<p>This site is currently a draft for what is intended to be a dynamic way to build nutritionally-balanced recipes, while estimating the ecological cost with land-use statistics. Until then, this site can be used as a foundation for building healthy, natural, low-impact diets.</p>
<p>This project is free, <a href="https://github.com/eldarflour/eldarflour.github.io/issues">open-source</a>, and public domain.</p>
