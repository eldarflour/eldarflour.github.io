<p>The average yield is <a href="https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/harvest/harvest-2016-growers-enjoy-soya-success-crop-yields-impress"><em>250g/m<sup>2</sup></em></a>. As organic tends to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X">yield <em>80%</em> that of chemical methods</a>, the average organic yield is assumed to be <em>200g/m<sup>2</sup></em>. For <em>125g</em> a day, one needs <em>(125ร365) รท 200</em>, or <strong>228m<sup>2</sup></strong>. Note, this is for Britain, which is not the best climate for soy.</p>
