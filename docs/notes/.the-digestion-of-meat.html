<h1 id="the-digestion-of-meat">The Digestion of Meat</h1>
<p>The goal of the stomach and the small intestines is to take whatever theyâ€™re given and break it down into the individual base components; the sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. These base components are then absorbed through the intestinal wall. However, some things can leave the small intestines undigested, in which case they will move on to the colon, where the resident bacteria will attempt to digest them in a process that can be called fermenting, putrefying, or rotting.</p>
<p>When the bacteria of the colon are fed undigested plant matter, i.e. fibre, it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fiber#Short-chain_fatty_acids">generally considered beneficial</a>. However, when they are fed undigested protein, <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/2017/04/11/what-animal-protein-does-in-your-colon/">particularly animal protein</a>, they can produce toxins, such as ammonia.</p>
<p>It is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c_fJnIr5Fw">commonly stated</a> that meat cannot escape the small intestines without being broken down. However, <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/2017/04/11/what-animal-protein-does-in-your-colon/">significant quantities of animal protein have been found entering the colon undigested</a>, and therefore being fermented, or putrefied, by the bacteria of the colon.</p>
<p>While the debate regarding the mechanism will likely continue, the significant link between colon cancer and meat consumption <a href="https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/new-research-says-even-moderate-red-and-processed-meat-eaters-at-risk-of-bowel-cancer/">is generally accepted</a>.</p>
