<p>The consumption of animal products is a practice intertwined with human history, culture, and <a href="/basics">health</a>. However, it is worth knowing the origin of these products, particularly in the modern era where <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/">the production techniques</a> tend to come as a surprise, and raise questions about whether these products can be considered healthy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production">despite</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock">the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse#Worker_exploitation_concerns">presence</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24525584">of</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Safety_issues">various</a> <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/243100.html">nutrients</a>.</p>
<p>Besides that, the land requirement for meat is steep. If everyone in <a href="/notes/british-land-available">Britain</a> obtained their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&amp;dbid=107#foodchart">B<sub>12</sub></a> from beef, while otherwise following <a href="/basics">a basic diet</a>, then there would be land for around <a href="/notes/land-for-meat"><em>7 million people</em></a>, or <a href="/notes/land-for-meat"><em>21 million</em></a> for lamb, <a href="/notes/land-for-meat"><em>56 million</em></a> for factory-farmed pork, or <a href="/notes/land-for-chicken"><em>29 million</em></a> for home-raised chicken. With a population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom"><em>65 million people</em></a>, meat would not be a viable source of B<sub>12</sub> for Britain as a whole, not when self-sufficiency is considered and factory-farms are avoided.</p>
