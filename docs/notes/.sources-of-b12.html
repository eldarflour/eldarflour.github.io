<h1 id="vitamin-b12">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub></h1>
<p>Here’s an unpleasant thought: just <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00007957">half a gram</a> of dried human fæces contains the daily requirement of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&amp;dbid=107">vitamin B<sub>12</sub></a>. The bacteria that produce vitamin B<sub>12</sub> inhabit fæces in particular, and as a result, the <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-animals-absorb-their-B12-by-the-bacteria-in-their-guts-or-do-they-need-to-eat-their-poop-afterwards-to-absorb-it/answer/Michael-McClennen">rabbit eats its own fæces</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12#Bacteria_and_archaea">second stomach of the cow eats the fæces of the first</a>, and humans, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil#History">traditionally</a> grew their crops with <a href="https://www.growveg.co.uk/guides/using-animal-manure-in-the-vegetable-garden/">‘night soil’</a>, leading to <a href="https://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7d.shtml">normal levels of B<sub>12</sub> in their blood</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps for similar reasons, other sources include <a href="/notes/duckweed"><strong>duckweed</strong></a>; <strong>algæ</strong>, including <a href="/notes/chlorella">chlorella</a> and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf0101556">coccolithophores</a>; <strong>seaweed</strong>, including <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf981065c">nori</a>, aka laver, and <a href="https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#various">dulse</a>; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&amp;dbid=107">animal products</a>.</p>
<h2 id="animal-products">Animal Products</h2>
<p>The consumption of animal products is a practice intertwined with human history, culture, and <a href="/basics">health</a>. However, it is worth knowing the origin of these products, particularly in the modern era where <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/">the production techniques</a> tend to come as a surprise, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbeMdYkKDc">raise</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNED7GJLY7I">questions</a> of whether these products can be considered healthy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production">despite</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock">the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse#Worker_exploitation_concerns">presence</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24525584">of</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Safety_issues">various</a> <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/243100.html">nutrients</a>.</p>
<p>The land requirement is also steep. For example, if everyone in <a href="/notes/british-land-available">Britain</a> obtained their B<sub>12</sub> from home-raised poultry, while otherwise following <a href="/basics">a basic diet</a>, then there would be land for around <a href="/notes/land-for-chicken"><em>45 million people</em></a>, with even less for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore">beef, lamb, pork, and cheese</a>. With a population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom"><em>65 million people</em></a>, meat and dairy are not viable sources of B<sub>12</sub> for Britain as a whole, not when self-sufficiency is considered and <a href="https://landofhopeandglory.org/">factory-farms</a> are avoided.</p>
<p>Besides that, the fæces of omnivores and carnivores can’t be used for manure; <a href="https://www.growveg.co.uk/guides/using-animal-manure-in-the-vegetable-garden/">it’s too toxic</a>. This is especially relevant for humans, as humans inherited their digestive tract from their frugivore ancestors; <a href="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20200709022251961-0188:9781316339916:11859fig6_4.png">its long and ridged nature</a> ferments food for longer, extracting more nutrients. Whereas the lion has <a href="http://lion-nutrition.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/9/9/26992359/1430210.png">a short and smooth digestive tract</a>, more suited to a diet that is prone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_spoilage">rotting quickly and becoming toxic</a>. It therefore avoids prolonged intestinal exposure to toxic material, <a href="/notes/the-digestion-of-meat">which is difficult for humans</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>While algæ and duckweed are widely available, replicate rapidly, and have impressive nutritional profiles, they are rarely used in food. For this reason, it may be useful to look at them as ways of making <a href="/notes/duckweed">natural supplements</a> instead. For synthetic supplements and fortification, note that more than a few micrograms <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/b12-energy/537654/">may be harmful</a>.</p>
<p>Or, a lot of seaweed. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/beliefs/fournobletruths_1.shtml">Life is suffering.</a></p>
