<p>Duckweed is <a href="/notes/duckweed-b12">potentially a good source of vitamin B<sub>12</sub></a>, and it has the additional benefit of being able to replace the <a href="/basics">leaves</a>, due to its <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938">high vitamin K</a> content, as well as the vegetables if two or three times more are added.</p>
<p>It can also be grown in <a href="/notes/land-for-duckweed">a small aquarium</a>.</p>
<p>However, it’s not commonly available, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbUm3YHZ4Q">not due to a lack of supply</a>. As with <a href="/notes/chlorella">chlorella</a>, it may be useful to look at duckweed as a way to make natural vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and K supplements.</p>
<p>B<sub>12</sub> content <a href="https://www.b12-vitamin.com/algae/">may rely on a non-sterile growing environment</a>. It is then also worth highlighting that it’s <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938">usually washed in hot water</a>, before being dried. At this point in time though, not enough seems to be known about the B<sub>12</sub> content of duckweed and the environmental factors required for its presence.</p>
