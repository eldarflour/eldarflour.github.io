<p>Duckweed is a prolific replicator, only requiring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbUm3YHZ4Q">a small aquarium</a>, while being <a href="/notes/duckweed-b12">potentially a good source of vitamin B<sub>12</sub></a> and <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938">vitamin K</a>. It also has a more neutral flavour than <a href="/notes/chlorella">chlorella</a>.</p>
<p>However, note that the B<sub>12</sub> content of duckweed is currently uncertain and <a href="https://www.b12-vitamin.com/algae/">may rely on a non-sterile growing environment</a>. It’s also worth highlighting that it’s <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938">usually washed in hot water</a> before being dried.</p>
