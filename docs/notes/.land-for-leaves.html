<p>The seeding rate is <a href="https://wikifarmer.com/how-to-grow-spinach-from-seeding-to-harvesting/"><em>10kg/acre</em></a>, and the average yield is around <a href="https://wikifarmer.com/how-to-grow-spinach-from-seeding-to-harvesting/"><em>2000g/m<sup>2</sup></em></a>. As organic tends to yield <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X"><em>80%</em></a> that of chemical methods, the average organic yield is then assumed to be <em>1600g/m<sup>2</sup>,</em> or <em>6475kg/acre</em>. For <em>30g</em> a day, one needs <em>(30×365) ÷ 1600</em>, or <strong>7m<sup>2</sup></strong>. This gives an approximation for those getting their <a href="https://www.checkyourfood.com/ingredients/ingredient/1726/spinach-powder">vitamin K from dried leaves</a>, but it’s worth noting that various leaves would normally be grown <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/vegetables/spinach/grow-your-own">all year round</a>, improving the yield.</p>
