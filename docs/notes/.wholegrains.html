<p>Where the term ‘wholegrain’ is used, it is referring to the type of flour which has had nothing removed and so it includes the white starch, the bran, and the germ. The terms ‘whole-wheat’ and ‘wholemeal’ usually refer to a type of white flour which has had the bran mixed back in.</p>
<p>As wholegrain flour contains the germ, and the germ contains oils which go rancid quickly, grain should ideally be stored whole and ground when needed. Note, blenders do a good job of ‘grinding’ grains.</p>
