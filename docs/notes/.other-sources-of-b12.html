<p>It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil">historically common</a> to use <a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2017/06/14/making-modern-day-night-soil/">compost from human manure</a> in agriculture. Individuals using ‘night soil’ to grow their crops were found to have <a href="https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#nightsoil">normal levels of B<sub>12</sub></a> in their blood, despite a nearly-vegan diet. This is not entirely unexpected, given the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/283781a0">high levels</a> of the bacteria that produce B<sub>12</sub> in the later stages of the human digestive system. It may be worth noting that ordinary dirt is <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00007957">not a very concentrated source</a>. Otherwise, some may prefer a tablet.</p>
