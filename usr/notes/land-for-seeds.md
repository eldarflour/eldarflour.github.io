## Flax seeds
The seeding rate is [*20kg/acre*](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/species/104/linseed),
and the average yield is around [*150g/m^2^*](https://www.yara.co.uk/crop-nutrition/novel-crops/linseed/).
As organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the average organic yield is then assumed to be
*120g/m^2^,* or *486kg/acre*, or 24 times the amount planted. For *10g* a
day, one needs *((10×365)÷120) + (((10×365)÷24)÷120)*, or **32m^2^**.

## Hemp seeds
The seeding rate is [*18kg/acre*](https://fyi.extension.wisc.edu/hemp/industrial-hemp-agronomics/),
and the average yield is around [*78g/m^2^*](https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/fiber/industrial-hemp).
As organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the average organic yield is assumed to be
*62g/m^2^,* or *251kg/acre*, or 14 times the amount planted. For *10g*
a day, one needs *((10×365)÷62) + (((10×365)÷14)÷62)*, or **63m^2^**.
