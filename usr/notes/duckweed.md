Duckweed is a prolific replicator, only requiring [a small aquarium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbUm3YHZ4Q),
while being [potentially a good source of vitamin B~12~](/notes/duckweed-b12)
and [vitamin K](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938). It also
has a more neutral flavour than [chlorella](/notes/chlorella).

However, note that the B~12~ content of duckweed is currently uncertain and
[may rely on a non-sterile growing environment](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/algae/).
It's also worth highlighting that it's [usually washed in hot water](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938)
before being dried.
