Duckweed is [potentially a good source of vitamin B~12~](/notes/duckweed-b12),
and it has the additional benefit of being able to replace the [leaves](/basics),
due to its [high vitamin K](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938)
content, as well as the vegetables if two or three times more are added.

It can also be grown in [a small aquarium](/notes/land-for-duckweed).

However, it's not commonly available, and [not due to a lack of supply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbUm3YHZ4Q).
As with [chlorella](/notes/chlorella), it may be useful to look at duckweed
as a way to make natural vitamin B~12~ and K supplements.

B~12~ content [may rely on a non-sterile growing environment](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/algae/).
It is then also worth highlighting that it's [usually washed in hot water](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/6938),
before being dried. At this point in time though, not enough seems to be known
about the B~12~ content of duckweed and the environmental factors required for
its presence.
