## Strawberries
The average yield is [*2000g/m^2^*](https://vegetablegrowersnews.com/article/tunnels-varieties-double-uk-berry-yields/).
As organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the average organic yield is then assumed to be
*1600g/m^2^*. For *350g* a day, increased to account for the [loses from drying](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf),
one needs *(350×365) ÷ 1600*, or **80m^2^**. Note, this is using polytunnels.

## Blackcurrants
The average yield is [600g/m^2^](http://www.calu.bangor.ac.uk/Technical%20leaflets/020204Blackcurrants.pdf).
As organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the average organic yield is then assumed to be
*480g/m^2^*. For *100g* a day, increased to account for the [loses from drying](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf),
one needs *(100×365) ÷ 480*, or **76m^2^**.
