## Sunflower seeds
The seeding rate is [*10kg/acre*](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/species/62/sunflower),
and the average yield is around [*224g/m^2^*](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/alternativeag/cropproduction/sunflower.html).
As organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the organic yield is then assumed to be *179g/m^2^,*
or *724kg/acre*, or 72 times the amount planted. As around [*40%*](http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/oilpress.html)
is generally lost in the dehulling process, the yield without hulls is then
assumed to be *107g/m^2^*. For *30g* a day, one needs
*((30×365)÷107) + (((30×365)÷72)÷179)*, or **103m^2^**.
