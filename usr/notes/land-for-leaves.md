## Spinach
The seeding rate is [*10kg/acre*](https://wikifarmer.com/how-to-grow-spinach-from-seeding-to-harvesting/),
and the average yield is around [*2000g/m^2^*](https://wikifarmer.com/how-to-grow-spinach-from-seeding-to-harvesting/).
As organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the average organic yield is then assumed to be
*1600g/m^2^,* or *6475kg/acre*. For *30g* a day, one needs *(30ร365) รท 1600*,
or **7m^2^**. This gives an approximation for those getting their
[vitamin K from dried leaves](https://www.checkyourfood.com/ingredients/ingredient/1726/spinach-powder),
but it's worth noting that various leaves would normally be grown
[all year round](https://www.rhs.org.uk/vegetables/spinach/grow-your-own),
improving the yield.
