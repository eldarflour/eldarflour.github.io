## Wheat
The seeding rate is [*75kg/acre*](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/species/105/wheat),
and the organic yield is around [*330g/m^2^*](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/55/10/820/274240),
or *1335kg/acre*, or 18 times the amount planted. For *700g* a day, one needs
*((700×365)÷330) + (((700×365)÷18)÷330)*, or **817m^2^**.

## Oats
The seeding rate is [*70kg/acre*](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/species/106/oats).
The average yield for standard oats was *545g/m^2^* across [2019](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/868943/structure-jun2019prov-UK-28feb20.pdf)
and [2020](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/946161/structure-jun2020final-uk-22dec20.pdf).
As the [naked varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avena_nuda) have
a [25%](https://www.premiumcrops.com/spring-naked-oats.html) lower yield
than the husked varieties, and organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the organic yield for naked oats is assumed to
be around *327g/m^2^*, or *1323kg/acre*, or 19 times the amount planted.
For *600g* a day, one needs *((600×365)÷327) + (((600×365)÷19)÷327)*,
or **705m^2^**.

## Potatoes
The organic yield is around [*1500g/m^2^*](https://www.organicresearchcentre.com/manage/authincludes/article_uploads/Potato_guide_ORC_Download.pdf).
For *3kg* a day, one needs *((3000×365)÷1500)*, or **730m^2^**.
