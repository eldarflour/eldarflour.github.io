# Sources of B~12~

Here's an unpleasant thought: just [half a gram](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00007957)
of dried human fæces contains the daily requirement of [vitamin B~12~](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107).
The bacteria that produce B~12~ inhabit fæces in particular. For this reason,
the [rabbit eats its own fæces](https://www.quora.com/Do-animals-absorb-their-B12-by-the-bacteria-in-their-guts-or-do-they-need-to-eat-their-poop-afterwards-to-absorb-it/answer/Michael-McClennen),
the [second stomach of the cow eats the fæces of the first](https://www.quora.com/Do-animals-absorb-their-B12-by-the-bacteria-in-their-guts-or-do-they-need-to-eat-their-poop-afterwards-to-absorb-it/answer/Michael-McClennen),
and humans, [traditionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil#History)
grew their crops with [‘night soil’](https://www.growveg.co.uk/guides/using-animal-manure-in-the-vegetable-garden/),
leading to [normal levels of B~12~ in their blood](https://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7d.shtml).

Perhaps for this reason, other sources include [**duckweed**](/notes/duckweed);
**algæ**, including [chlorella](/notes/chlorella) and [coccolithophores](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf0101556);
**seaweed**, including [nori](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf981065c), aka
laver, and [dulse](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#various);
and [animal products](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107).

The consumption of animal products is a practice intertwined with human
history, culture, and [health](/basics). However, it is worth knowing
the origin of these products, particularly in the modern era where
[the production techniques](https://www.dominionmovement.com/)
tend to come as a surprise, and
[can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ai1xpi8bW0&list=PLw-_llSdTbqeGXrM1L3bEiUVAa_YNbIGi)
[raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elLPtQjqddQ)
[questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNED7GJLY7I)
of whether these products can be considered healthy,
[despite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production)
[the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock)
[presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse#Worker_exploitation_concerns)
[of](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24525584)
[various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Safety_issues)
[nutrients](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/243100.html).

The land requirement is also steep. If everyone in [Britain](/notes/british-land-available)
obtained their B~12~ from home-raised chicken, while otherwise
following [a basic diet](/basics), then there would be land for
around [*45 million people*](/notes/land-for-chicken), with even
less for [beef, lamb, pork, and cheese](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore).
With a population of [*65 million people*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom),
meat and dairy are not viable sources of B~12~ for Britain as a whole,
not when self-sufficiency is considered and [factory-farms](https://landofhopeandglory.org/)
are avoided.

Besides that, the fæces of omnivores and carnivores can't be used for
manure; [it's too toxic](https://www.growveg.co.uk/guides/using-animal-manure-in-the-vegetable-garden/).
This is especially relevant for humans, as humans inherited their digestive
tract from their frugivore ancestors; [its long and ridged nature](https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20200709022251961-0188:9781316339916:11859fig6_4.png)
ferments the food for longer, extracting more nutrients. The lion, however,
has [a short and smooth digestive tract](http://lion-nutrition.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/9/9/26992359/1430210.png),
as their diet is prone to rotting quickly and becoming toxic. The lion,
therefore, avoids prolonged intestinal exposure to toxic material,
[which is difficult for omnivorous and carnivorous humans](https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/new-research-says-even-moderate-red-and-processed-meat-eaters-at-risk-of-bowel-cancer/).

Otherwise, algæ and duckweed are widely available, replicate rapidly,
and have impressive nutritional profiles. However, they never really
became culinary staples. For that reason, it may be useful to look at
them as ways of making [natural supplements](/notes/duckweed), rather
than as food. For synthetic supplements or fortification, note that
[excess B~12~ can be harmful](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/b12-energy/537654/);
a few micrograms is enough.

Or, you'll need to eat a lot of seaweed. [Life is suffering.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/beliefs/fournobletruths_1.shtml)
