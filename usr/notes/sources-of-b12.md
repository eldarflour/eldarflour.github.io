It is likely that [significant amounts](https://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7d.shtml)
of dietary B~12~ [traditionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil#History)
came through [contamination](https://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7d.shtml).
In fact, here's an unpleasant thought: just [half a gram](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00007957)
of dried human fæces contains the daily requirement of vitamin B~12~. This
is less likely since the introduction of chemical agriculture, but, previously,
[‘night soil’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil) was commonly used
throughout the world.

Perhaps for this reason, other sources include [**duckweed**](/notes/duckweed);
**algæ**, including [chlorella](/notes/chlorella) and [coccolithophores](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf0101556);
**seaweed**, including [nori](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf981065c), aka laver,
and [dulse](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#various);
and [animal products](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107),
although [their viability is debatable](/notes/animal-products).

However, despite their wide availability, rapid replication, and impressive
nutritional profiles, algæ and duckweed have never really become culinary staples.
For that reason, it may be useful to look at them as ways of making [natural B~12~ supplements](/notes/duckweed),
rather than as food. Otherwise, for synthetic supplements, note that excessive
B~12~ levels [can be harmful](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/b12-energy/537654/).
