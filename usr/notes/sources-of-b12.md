# Vitamin B~12~

Here's an unpleasant thought: just [half a gram](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00007957)
of dried human fæces contains the daily requirement of [vitamin B~12~](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107).
The bacteria that produce vitamin B~12~ inhabit fæces in particular, and as
a result, the [rabbit eats its own fæces](https://www.quora.com/Do-animals-absorb-their-B12-by-the-bacteria-in-their-guts-or-do-they-need-to-eat-their-poop-afterwards-to-absorb-it/answer/Michael-McClennen),
the [second stomach of the cow eats the fæces of the first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12#Bacteria_and_archaea),
and humans, [traditionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil#History)
grew their crops with [‘night soil’](https://www.growveg.co.uk/guides/using-animal-manure-in-the-vegetable-garden/),
leading to [normal levels of B~12~ in their blood](https://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7d.shtml).

Perhaps for similar reasons, other sources include [**duckweed**](/notes/duckweed);
**algæ**, including [chlorella](/notes/chlorella) and [coccolithophores](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf0101556);
**seaweed**, including [nori](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf981065c), aka
laver, and [dulse](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#various);
and [animal products](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107).

## Animal Products

The consumption of animal products is a practice intertwined with human
history, culture, and [health](/basics). However, it is worth knowing
the origin of these products, particularly in the modern era where
[the production techniques](https://www.dominionmovement.com/)
tend to come as a surprise, and
[raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbeMdYkKDc)
[questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNED7GJLY7I)
of whether these products can be considered healthy,
[despite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production)
[the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock)
[presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse#Worker_exploitation_concerns)
[of](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24525584)
[various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Safety_issues)
[nutrients](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/243100.html).

The land requirement is also steep. For example, if everyone in
[Britain](/notes/british-land-available) obtained their B~12~ from
home-raised poultry, while otherwise following [a basic diet](/basics),
then there would be land for around [*45 million people*](/notes/land-for-chicken),
with even less for [beef, lamb, pork, and cheese](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore).
With a population of [*65 million people*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom),
meat and dairy are not viable sources of B~12~ for Britain as a whole,
not when self-sufficiency is considered and [factory-farms](https://landofhopeandglory.org/)
are avoided.

Besides that, the fæces of omnivores and carnivores can't be used for
manure; [it's too toxic](https://www.growveg.co.uk/guides/using-animal-manure-in-the-vegetable-garden/).
This is especially relevant for humans, as humans inherited their digestive
tract from their frugivore ancestors; [its long and ridged nature](https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20200709022251961-0188:9781316339916:11859fig6_4.png)
ferments the food for longer, extracting more nutrients. The lion, however,
has [a short and smooth digestive tract](http://lion-nutrition.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/9/9/26992359/1430210.png),
as their diet is prone to rotting quickly and becoming toxic. The lion,
therefore, avoids prolonged intestinal exposure to toxic material,
[which is difficult for omnivorous and carnivorous humans](https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/new-research-says-even-moderate-red-and-processed-meat-eaters-at-risk-of-bowel-cancer/).

## Other

Algæ and duckweed are widely available, replicate rapidly, and have
impressive nutritional profiles, and yet they are rarely used in food.
For this reason, it may be useful to look at them as ways of making
[natural supplements](/notes/duckweed) instead. For synthetic supplements
and fortification, note that more than a few micrograms [may be harmful](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/b12-energy/537654/).

Or, a lot of seaweed. [Life is suffering.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/beliefs/fournobletruths_1.shtml)
