## Chicken, *home-raised*

Chickens eat [the same basic diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_feed)
as humans, i.e. [mostly grains and legumes](https://web.archive.org/web/20150325103301/http://www.chicken.org.au/page.php?id=6#Feed)
with sources of vitamins and minerals, while otherwise foraging for the rest.
High-tech nutritionally-complete chicken feeds are important for factory-farmed
chickens as they can't forage. Traditionally, however, chicken feed was more
supplementary, consisting of grain, scraps, and calcium.

Chickens tend to eat around [an eighth](https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/farming/nutrition-for-backyard-chicken-flocks/)
of [what a human eats](/basics), or around [*125 grams*](https://www.smallholderfeed.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Feeding-Hens-Factsheet.pdf)
of feed a day. As chicken feed [is basically grain](https://web.archive.org/web/20150325103301/http://www.chicken.org.au/page.php?id=6#Feed),
this would need around [*170m^2^*](/notes/land-for-staples) to produce
organically, or one twenty-fourth of an acre.

With a ‘harvest’ every [12 weeks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311553349_Are_carcass_and_meat_quality_of_male_dual-purpose_chickens_competitive_compared_to_slow-growing_broilers_reared_under_a_welfare-enhanced_organic_system),
each twenty-fourth will then produce *4.3 chickens* per year. With an average
weight of [3kg](https://pethelpful.com/farm-pets/the-top-10-dual-purpose-chicken-breeds),
and an average meat yield of [65%](https://yourmeatguide.com/whole-chicken-portions-meat-yield/),
each bird will then produce around *2kg* of meat, and so each twenty-fourth
will produce *8.6kg* of meat per year.

A human would need [*440g a day*](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107)
for the B~12~, or *160kg* per year, or eighty birds a year. This would require
nineteen twenty-fourths of an acre, or **3140m^2^**, or three-quarters of an
acre. A quarter of an acre would still be needed for the rest of the human's
nutrition.

Chickens shouldn't be kept on the same land that is being used to grow
their feed, as they would trample on it and uproot it. They would therefore
need more land for pasture, where the traditional stocking density is around
[50 birds an acre](https://www.plamondon.com/wp/how-many-chickens-per-acre/),
or two-fifths of an acre in this case.

On average, each human would be killing a bird every 5 days.
Feeding the world in this way would require the annual slaughter of
[*half a trillion birds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Negative_effects_on_poultry_workers).
