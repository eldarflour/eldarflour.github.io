Chlorella has an impressive nutrient profile, as well as being a good
[source of vitamin B~12~](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b03550),
something that is rare among vegan foods. However, many will find its taste
and colour to be somewhat unpleasant. Therefore, chlorella should probably be
viewed as a way to make natural B~12~ supplements, rather than as food.

Currently, it is not known which growing environments cause chlorella to
contain B~12~, and the amount that it can contain varies significantly. It
is likely that [it will be absent when grown in a sterile environment](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/algae/).
