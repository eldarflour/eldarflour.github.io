It was [historically common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_soil)
to use [compost from human manure](https://www.permaculturenews.org/2017/06/14/making-modern-day-night-soil/)
in agriculture. Individuals using ‘night soil’ to grow their crops were found
to have [normal levels of B~12~](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#nightsoil)
in their blood, despite a nearly-vegan diet. This is not entirely unexpected,
given the [high levels](https://www.nature.com/articles/283781a0) of the
bacteria that produce B~12~ in the later stages of the human digestive system.
Ordinary dirt, however, is [not a very concentrated source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00007957).
