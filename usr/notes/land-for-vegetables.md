## Sweet Potatoes
The average yield is [*1500g/m^2^*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0791-7_9).
As organic tends to [yield *80%* that of chemical methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X),
the average organic yield is assumed to be *1200g/m^2^*. For *130g* a day,
one needs *(130×365) ÷ 1200*, or **40m^2^**.

## Carrots
The average yield is [*4428g/m^2^*](http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/worldcarrots.html).
The average organic yield is then assumed to be *3542g/m^2^*. For *120g* a day,
doubled to account for the [loses from drying](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/retn/retn06.pdf),
one needs *(240×365) ÷ 3542*, or **25m^2^**.
