The consumption of animal products is a practice intertwined with human
history, culture, and [health](/basics). However, it is worth knowing the
origin of these products, particularly in the modern era where
[the production techniques](https://www.dominionmovement.com/) tend to come
as a surprise, and [raise questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNED7GJLY7I)
about whether these products can be considered healthy,
[despite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production)
[the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock)
[presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse#Worker_exploitation_concerns)
[of](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24525584)
[various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming_in_the_United_States#Safety_issues)
[nutrients](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/243100.html).

Besides that, the land requirement is steep. If everyone in [Britain](/notes/british-land-available)
obtained their [vitamin B~12~](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107#foodchart)
from home-raised chicken, while otherwise following [a basic diet](/basics),
then there would be land for around [*45 million people*](/notes/land-for-chicken),
with even less for conventionally-produced [beef, lamb, pork, and cheese](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore).
With a population of [*65 million people*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom),
meat and dairy would therefore not be viable sources of B~12~ for Britain
as a whole, not when self-sufficiency is considered and [factory-farms](https://landofhopeandglory.org/)
are avoided.
