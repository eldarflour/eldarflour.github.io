The consumption of animal products is a practice intertwined with human
history, culture, and [health](/basics). However, it is worth knowing the
origin of these products, particularly in the modern era where
[the production techniques](https://www.dominionmovement.com/) tend to come
as a surprise, and raise questions about whether these products can be
considered healthy, [despite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production)
[the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock)

Besides that, the land requirement for meat is steep. If everyone in
[Britain](/notes/british-land-available) obtained their B~12~ from beef,
while otherwise following [a basic diet](/basics), then there would be land
for around [*7 million people*](/notes/land-for-meat), or [*21 million*](/notes/land-for-meat)
for lamb, [*56 million*](/notes/land-for-meat) for factory-farmed pork, or
[*29 million*](/notes/land-for-chicken) for home-raised chicken. With a
population of [*65 million people*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom),
meat is not a viable source of B~12~ for Britain as a whole, at least
not when self-sufficiency is considered and factory-farms are avoided.
