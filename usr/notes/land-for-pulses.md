## Soybeans
The average yield is [*250g/m^2^*](https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/harvest/harvest-2016-growers-enjoy-soya-success-crop-yields-impress).
As organic tends to [yield *80%* that of chemical methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X),
the average organic yield is assumed to be *200g/m^2^*. For *125g* a day,
one needs *(125ร365) รท 200*, or **228m^2^**. Note, this is for Britain,
which is not the best climate for soy.
