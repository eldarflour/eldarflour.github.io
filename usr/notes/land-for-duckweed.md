The average yield is [*7200g of dry matter/m^2^*](https://juniperpublishers.com/ijesnr/IJESNR.MS.ID.555942.php).
As organic tends to yield [*80%*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1100182X)
that of chemical methods, the average organic yield is then assumed to be
*5760g of dry matter/m^2^,* or *23,310kg of dry matter/acre*. For *1g* a day,
one needs *(1ร365) รท 5760*, or **one square foot**.
