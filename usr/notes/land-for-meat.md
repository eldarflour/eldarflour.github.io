## Beef, *grass-fed*
A kilogram of beef requires around [*326m^2^*](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore)
to produce. Assuming a ‘harvest’ every [18 months](https://www.farmtransparency.org/kb/food/abattoirs/age-animals-slaughtered),
and a requirement of around [*120g a day*](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107)
for the B~12~, one would need *66kg per harvest*, or **21,520m^2^**.

## Lamb, *grass-fed*
A kilogram of lamb requires around [*370m^2^*](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore)
to produce. Assuming a harvest every [8 months](https://www.farmtransparency.org/kb/food/abattoirs/age-animals-slaughtered),
and a requirement of around [*70g a day*](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107),
one would need *17kg per harvest*, or **6300m^2^**.

## Pork, *factory-farmed*
A kilogram of pork requires around [*17m^2^*](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-kg-poore)
to produce. Assuming a harvest every [6 months](https://www.farmtransparency.org/kb/food/abattoirs/age-animals-slaughtered),
and a requirement of around [*220g a day*](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/167820/nutrients),
one would need *40kg per harvest*, or **680m^2^**. Note, this is a very
low estimate; it does not assume good conditions for the pigs, it is not
organic, nor is it free-range.
