This site is currently a draft for what is intended to be a dynamic way
to build nutritionally-balanced recipes, while estimating the ecological
cost with land-use statistics. Until then, this site can be used as
a foundation for building healthy, natural, low-impact diets.

This project is free, [open-source](https://github.com/eldarflour/eldarflour.github.io/issues),
and public domain.
