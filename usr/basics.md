**Staples,** *600g*, [*780m^2^*](/notes/land-for-staples), contain most of a
diet's nutrition, including the [fibre](https://web.archive.org/web/20210124021241id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=59),
[minerals](https://web.archive.org/web/20210121094444id_/http://whfoods.com/nutrientstoc.php),

and energy. Sources include [**wholegrain wheat**](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101053151id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=66#healthbenefits),

and ***buckwheat***. Less dense sources include ***maize***, ***potatoes***,

amount of energy. Around [a quarter](/notes/choline) should be legumes,
such as [soybeans](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/#h3)
or chickpeas, for the [choline](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126120914id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=50).

**Nuts,** *30g,* [*100m^2^*](/notes/land-for-nuts), *recently dehulled,* are

Many dark green leaves are good candidates, such as ***kale***, ***spinach***,
***chard***, ***cress***, ***coriander***, ***basil***, and ***parsley***. For
lighter leaves, such as ***lettuce***, the amounts should be doubled or tripled.

**Fruits,** *60g,* [*80m^2^*](/notes/land-for-fruits),

[cured for two days with gills facing the summer Sun](http://fungi.com/blogs/articles/place-mushrooms-in-sunlight-to-get-your-vitamin-d).

**Soil,** is unfortunately the preferred habitat of the bacteria that produce
[vitamin B~12~](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220012701id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=107).

*a gram of dried [**duckweed**](/notes/duckweed)*,
*a gram of dried [**chlorella**](/notes/chlorella)*,
*a sheet of dried [**nori**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf981065c)*,
aka ***purple laver***,
[and](/notes/other-sources-of-b12)
*perhaps [**dulse**](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/#various)*.
Note, the plants above will also want [good soil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgokeGNZnt8),
and a source of water.
