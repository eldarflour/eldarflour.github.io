**Wholegrain flour,** *80g,* [recently ground](/notes/wholegrains),
for the minerals and fibre. Sources include barley, wheat, oats, and rye.

**White flour,** *320g,* for the energy and texture; the amount can be
increased and decreased as needed. It is healthier if more of the white
flour is replaced with wholegrain, increasing the water.

**Nuts,** *25g,* *recently dehulled*, for the vitamin E and B~7~.
Sources include almonds, hazelnuts, and sunflower seeds.

**Seeds,** *15g,* [recently ground](/notes/seed-sensitivity), for the omega−3.
Sources include chia, hemp, flax, and walnuts. An alternative is a ml of
[algae oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed_oil).

**Carrot,** *20g powder,* for the vitamin A. An alternative is sweet
potato powder.

**Acerola,** *1g powder,* for the vitamin C. Other sources include
15g of rosehip powder, 30g of blackcurrant powder, or around half a gram
of ascorbic acid.

**Nutritional yeast,** *around 4g,* for the B vitamins, and the vitamin D
if it's been UV-treated. If it's not fortified with B~12~, either
blend in a tablet, or try [nori](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf981065c).

**Kelp,** *powder,* *a pinch,* for the iodine.

**Chalk,** *1g,* aka calcium carbonate. An alternative is tofu set with calcium sulphate.

**Salt,** *around 10g,* for the sodium. Preferably a low-sodium salt
for the increased potassium; they are usually half sodium chloride and
half potassium chloride. For a self-raising flour, instead add around 10g
of cream of tartar, aka potassium bitartrate, half that of baking soda, and
a few grams of standard salt. In which case, add the water at the end,
and be quick and gentle with the dough.

**Choline bitartrate,** *1g,* *optional,* for the choline, i.e. the B~4~. This
is less relevant for those that have replaced all of the white flour with wholegrains,
or [whole foods in general](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126120914id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=50#foodsources).
Otherwise, it's worth mixing with half a gram of baking soda and water to
neutralise the acidic taste.

**Leaves,** *3g dried or 12g fresh,* for the vitamin K. Here dried thyme
was used, but many dark green [leaves and herbs](/basics) are good candidates;
lighter green leaves have lower concentrations, such as lettuce, for which
80 grams is better.

**Olive oil,** *around a tablespoon,* *optional,* improves the texture. Alternatives
include coconut, avocado, hazelnut, and [high-oleic sunflower oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kGnfXXIKZM).

**Water,** *around 300ml,* [varies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage#Dough_hydration)
depending on method, ingredients, climate, etc. Add less at first, and more
if needed.

The result is a healthy, adaptable, almost-natural
[baking](https://www.manjulaskitchen.com/roti-chapati-flat-indian-bread/)
[flour](http://web.archive.org/web/20170216235835/http://robrhinehart.com/?p=424).
It is best paired with sources of [protein](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304164944id_/http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=92),
such as lentils, beans, peas, chickpeas, avocados, and tofu. Some of the ingredients
also work well on the side, e.g. in a smoothie, such as the barley, nuts, seeds,
leaves, fruits, [etc](/basics).
